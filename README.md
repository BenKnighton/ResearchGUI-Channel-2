(6 horizontal box) graphical user interface for conducting research and handling a large amount of notes whilst simultaneously looking cool.
In my world of Ideas and Concepts flooding into my brain every second, it is imperative that I stay organised. To do this I devised some programs that where tailored to the following criteria.
•	Functional – The Graphical user interface required a balance of simplicity and sophistication.
•	Intuitive – from the simplicity, an ergonomic efficient workflow.
•	Interactive – every button mush be attached to some meaning, and some function.
•	Unique movie design – inspired my movie designs, this would ensure I wouldn’t get bored of looking at a mundane monotonous design.
 
Using a mixture of programming languages, primarily Python, C++, and JavaScript for the graphical user interfaces I designed, I was able to successfully fulfil my requirements, and the end result was a product that I frequently use in my day-to-day engineering endeavours.
